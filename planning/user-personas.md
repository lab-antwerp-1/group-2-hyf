# User Personas

<!-- some introduction -->

We’re largely dependent on volunteers. That’s what makes us an engaged
grassroots community, as our students call it ‘the HYF family’.Our program is
adapted to suit people with different backgrounds, often in vulnerable
situations. We teach on Sundays to allow everyone to take control of their
personal lives during the week. Our program is free of charge, although we ask
for strong commitment during our 7 month-journey. And you know what? Many alumni
stay actively involved! Sharing is caring. Our curriculum is 100% open. We
believe in knowledge for the many, not the few.

## Learners / Users

- **Bio**: Andrea is middle school student taking her first biology class.
- **Needs/Goals**: She just needs enough information to write a 2-page report
  introducing trees.
- **Frustrations**: Most sources that talk about trees already assume you know
  quite a bit about plants and biology, this makes it challenging for her to get
  started on the report.
- **Scenario 1**: Andrea needs to do a 2-page report on trees and doesn't know
  where to start. She really does want to learn about trees, she would love to
  spend a month writing an in-depth report on them. But she also has a geometry
  test next week and an letter due for Dutch 101 so she's just trying to write
  the best report she can in a few days before moving on.

## Teachers / Volunteers

- **Bio**: Phyllis works in the local government, her job is to approve funding
  for citizen-led projects.
- **Needs/Goals**: She needs to meet with citizen groups to review their
  proposals and funding requests. If their proposals are solid and their funding
  requests are reasonable she is authorized to provide funding up to €3000 per
  year. This requires learning a little bit about a lot topics so she can judge
  citizen proposals.
- **Frustrations**: It is usually hard to find resources that provide enough
  intro-level knowledge about a topic for her to judge a proposal, without
  overwhelming her. Most sources either have too much info or not exactly the
  information she needs to understand a proposal.
- **Scenario 1**: She needs to attend a meeting next week with a group of
  citizens volunteering to plant and maintain trees in public parks. She needs
  to know enough about how trees work so she can judge if this group will
  actually be able to maintain the trees, and to decide if the amount of funding
  they request is reasonable.

          Our 8-month program is divided into 12 modules. The last module is a
          6-weeks intensive Final Project where students work on a real project
          with a real partner. Our training takes place at BeCentral (Brussels)
          every Sunday. During the week, students are supported online in their
          self-study, homework and peer learning.

# User Personas

<!-- some introduction -->

We’re largely dependent on volunteers. That’s what makes us an engaged
grassroots community, as our students call it ‘the HYF family’.Our program is
adapted to suit people with different backgrounds, often in vulnerable
situations. We teach on Sundays to allow everyone to take control of their
personal lives during the week. Our program is free of charge, although we ask
for strong commitment during our 7 month-journey. And you know what? Many alumni
stay actively involved! Sharing is caring. Our curriculum is 100% open. We
believe in knowledge for the many, not the few.
